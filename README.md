# Repainting_Masterpiece
School project made for my creative coding class in Seoul Korea with two korean team members.
The sketch was made using p5.js.
The sketch is available/runnable at

For the project, we were asked to make a generative design system that takes user input to influence multiple parameters of the generative design using sliders.
We chose to make designs meant to look like famous portraits by generating different shapes (circles, lines, triangles, rectangles) of varying sizes. The user can choose between three portraits by clicking on the corresponding buttons. The user can switch between shapes he generates by clicking on the sketch and can have multiple shapes overlap. The user can also influence the size of the different shapes by using the sliders.
